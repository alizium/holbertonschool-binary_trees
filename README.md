ðŸ§  Binary Trees
ðŸ“š Description
This project explores the fundamentals of binary trees, a core data structure in computer science. A binary tree is a hierarchical structure in which each node has at most two children â€” referred to as the left and right child.

The goal of this project is to implement various operations on binary trees, such as creation, insertion, traversal, and computation of properties like height and depth.

ðŸ§ª Features / Functions
binary_tree_node: creates a new node

binary_tree_insert_left: inserts a node as the left child

binary_tree_insert_right: inserts a node as the right child

binary_tree_delete: deletes an entire tree

binary_tree_is_leaf: checks if a node is a leaf

binary_tree_is_root: checks if a node is the root

binary_tree_preorder: traverses a tree using pre-order

binary_tree_inorder: traverses a tree using in-order
